### SQL Best Practices
- complying with coding style is crucial since you will always work in a team  
  
#### Clean Code
- Code that is *focused* and *understandable* and must be readable, logical and changeable
- *Good code* is the one that humans can understand and not computers
- *Good practice* implies you will choose the version that will be easiest to read and understand  

#### Naming variables or SQL ojects
- *shorter*, *meaningful* names, conveying *specific* information
- purchase_number
- PurchaseNumber
- customer_purchase_unique_number
- purchase number
- Names will constitute 80% of your code  
#### Readability
- Horizontal and vertical organization of code
- colour using ad-hoc software that re-organizes code and colours different words consistently
- use the relevant analogical tool provided in workbench
- intervene *manually* and adjust your code as you like  
#### Comments
- a way to convey a message to someone who reads our code
